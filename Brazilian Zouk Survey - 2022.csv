That was the hardest question for me - I’ve been dancing Zouk a long time, but I don’t teach, I compete irregularly. I’m also in a very competitive region with a lot of talented Zouk dancers and so my opinion of what advanced/int/novice is looks a lot different than someone from a smaller scene might perceive and that is different still compared to Brazilian standards. Less experienced dancers will often overestimate their skill and more experienced dancers tend to underestimate their skills. Using more objective criteria such as competition level, whether or not someone is a local or international instructor might be a better way to gage. Also, I can’t remember, but if you didn’t ask someone about where they are from and what country they are from-I would. There’s a lot of geographical variability "

There is a strong sense of right and wrong out there and it is killing people's egos. It is not about that. It is about safety and consent. The most important thing in any dance is attitude, having fun! I will take that over dancing with a solemn pro any day. So we should really focus on that over getting technique right. That would be way more enjoyable for beginners and way more accurate to the importance of dance.","A","B","B","A","B","B","You need to rethink some of the assumptions made in this survey. In particular you have really heaped styles of classes in to buckets that don't really make practical sense. Like pattern focus vs harder concept? That is so random. To be clear, I prefer lab classes. I want to be given a concept or structure to work with then have at it. I want to be free to switch at will and reach out to the teacher for specific feedback when needed. They can give us a few activities but i have found in my 9 years that i get the most info in this format. The way you are suggesting is antiquated. Common, but antiquated nonetheless. Like we can go over a ""pattern"" but that just seems like a superficial term. It is really about building structures and foundations that make you a good dancers. The conceptualization of a pattern is a beginner way of thinking. So you may want to consider experience level in your class formats. I understand you had general concepts as a category but both of these buckets are too vague. It doesnt really get to the core of good teaching because you kinda need both. Further, many studies have been published to show that ""learning styles"" is a false concept. Ultimately expertise causes the same areas in the brain to fire on brain scans. So I would throw that question out and change it to what makes instruction the most effective. The answer honestly is demoing the movement, then walking through each piece together step by step. No glossing over stuff. So where is the body at each step in the movement. Then gradually speed it up. That is is all it takes. Also taking some time to clarify the why we do this. Also you are trying to figure out the most important things for events? The quality of artists and the quality of dancers. I could care less about the number. Dance floor quality isn't negotiable. Like yes dancing on the beach is fun but if you are going to teach you need a proper floor for safety reasons. Also who the dj is doesn't matter as much as their behavior. Do they read the crowd. Do they play a variety of music? Honestly a good Playlist is fine if it is put together well. You really could have dove deeper into what makes good music. Dynamic and mellow don't cover the full zouk spectrum. First of all I can't stand the traditional zouk and lambda music and I and definitely not alone. I would pay good money to cut that crap out. I would love to go to an event knowing that wouldn't be there. But on a more technical note it is good to have music with different rhythms to practice the different timings of movements. There are at least 5 variations instead of the standard slow quick quick. It is nice to practice that as am advanced dancer and if djs don't get that I don't want them. Also it is nice to have music with emotional variety. Like some songs sound nice but they sound they come out of a factory machine. Very  forumlaic predictable and redundant and hence less fun. (They can be good for practicing and beginners but not overplayed) But a song with real character a real story arc and change stays interesting. Something more human and less robotic a song where there is a very hugh level of artistic skill that went into it. In summary I think you can reach a lot deeper with your questions and more precisely target what is important. Oh another thing? Did you forget organizers? That is the main thing I look at. I know how much each one cares about people over money and that's who ultimately produces the best events. I can just trust their mindset. More food for thought for you!"

At socials, the more experienced dancers should (should) absolutely dance with beginners to give them a sense of belonging in the community. Even though I have been dancing for a while, I recently went to a social in a different scene than where I usually dance, and one of the instructors made a point of asking me to dance. This made me feel so welcome and also gave us both a very nice opportunity to explore our dance styles. 

However, one of my main frustrations with the community is that there are certain experienced dancers, both in my local community and around the country, that will only dance with experienced dancers.

There's a phenomenon in the USA, if not more widespread, where a lot of leads are male and either caucasian or asian, and so have not grown up with musicality and body movement in their bodies. Combine that with a culture that does not encourage personal artistic body expression in males and you have lots of leads that don't know how to enjoy a dance with few moves and don't know how to be musical. That means they need to know moves to dance, and follows get bored when leads don't have enough moves. So the follows go to the experienced leads that pushed through the slog of learning musicality and stay dancing with the experienced leads because it may be their only good dance of the night since they don't want to dance with beginner leads. This leads to very long dances at socials that ostracize beginner leads because they are left on the side of the dance floor with no one wanting to dance with them. This leads to them leaving the scene, increasing the number of follows, who can additionally learn more quickly than leads since following is easier than leading until you get to the higher end of novice/intermediate. So there is a huge number gap in beginner leads and follows that then gets exacerbated by the lack of social spaces and social culture in zouk communities that encourage training so that you can get people to actually dance with you. These people that have slogged through then feel entitled to their longer dances (sometimes 1.5 hour dances, which is absolutely ridiculous) and don't give back to the community of beginner dancers at all. Zouk organizers need to cater to new leads to teach them how to be musical in a culture that celebrates personal body artistic expression in women and show them how to have fun and be comfortable with fewer moves so that follows can have fun with them, and follows need to stop being so goddamn stuck up and do their part in making the community a welcoming place so they can get more leads. That needs to be combined with venue spaces that have socialization components where people can build connections outside of the dance itself so that newer leads don't feel like all they have to contribute is their lesser knowledge when they are in fact also people who can be fun to be around, even if they don't know how to dance yet. Don't even get me started on the conflation of ""incorrect"" with ""bad"" and how follows will not dance with leads who can't do something ""right"" or the way ""they want it to be done."" They need to contribute to the dance too, not just expect everything to come from the lead.

For FOLLOWS, they need to be taught how to safely protect themselves in a dance and learn to speak up when a lead is being forceful or hurting them, while the leads need to be taught how to do moves properly and accept advice on making sure their dancing is comfortable. For follows, they also need to learn how and when to deny leads and they also need to be shown that they have a place or people in the community that they can go to when (not if) a male does something untoward, be it something slightly creepy all the way to sexual assault. And women need to speak the hell up. This is a culture that needs to be created from the ground up to welcome people into zouk more easily and make them want to stay, rather than a place that harbors predators.","A","B","B","B","B","A","I'd say go to the many popular zouk nerd threads about safety, zouk timing, community building, move definitions, competition organization and judging, long dance etiquette, conflation of sex and sensuality, intrusion of performance in smaller events, and timeliness/lateness of events"

Ask about outdoor vs indoor socials. International travel for zouk.
